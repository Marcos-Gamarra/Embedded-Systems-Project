How does this work?
There are three parts at play here:
    - The wio terminal (controlling the car)
    - A phone (acting as a camera)
    - A server (acting as a middleman)

The car will start to move forward and using the ultrasonic sensor it will detect if there is a "traffic sign" in front of it.
If there is, it will stop and send a request to the server indicating that it has encountered a traffic sign. 
The server will then send a request to the camera to take a picture of the traffic sign.
The camera will then take a picture and send it back to the server.
The server will extract the text from the image and send the appropriate command to the wio terminal.

How to run this?
    - Start the server by running `python server.py`
    - For the camera, cd into the camera directory and run the following commands:
        - `npm install`
        - `npm run dev -- --host"
    - Upload the crash_avoidance_car.ino file to the wio terminal

    Once this is done, setup a hotspot on the computer running the server and connect the wio terminal and the camera to it.
    For the camera, you need to go to the browser and type in the ip address of the computer running the server.
